Slovenian translation support for [AlpineQuest](https://www.alpinequest.net/) app. Simply the best outdoor navigation app you can get for your Android.


**Disclaimer**
*I've invented some new Slovenian words because we do not have a meaningful translation. Or there are multiple words with the same meaning. I decided to choose the ones that are most logical.I'm not a geographer or translator so if any of my Slovenian colleagues is upset about a certain translation please feel free to suggest a better solution and I will push new better translations ASAP.*
